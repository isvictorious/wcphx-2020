[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Genesis Sample repository](https://github.com/studiopress/genesis-sample) to your own GitHub account, then clone it to work on locally:

    git clone git@github.com:you-username/genesis-sample.git

Create a new branch to work on your changes. New branches should be forked from the `develop` branch.

    git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature

Make your changes and commit your code.

When you're ready, [create a pull request](https://github.com/studiopress/genesis-sample/pulls) to outline and contribute your changes.

To increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Lint your code to check that it conforms to WordPress standards. Learn more about the [developer tooling to help lint your code](https://github.com/studiopress/genesis-sample#for-developers).
* Do not increment the child theme version as part of your pull request. We'll take care of this for you prior to each release.
