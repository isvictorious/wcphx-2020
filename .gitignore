# 2. !folder-name/**  <-- includes the Plugin and sub level files recursively, except for the "Ignore some other system generated files" rules below

# WordPress specific files
# NOTE:
#   WP Engine automatically updates part or all of WordPress under certain
#   circumstances, so generally it is desirable to not version control copies of
#   the. However, in case you do have some specific need to version control
#   these files, you can comment out these lines.

# WP Engine specific files
# NOTE:
#   These files are specific to running a WordPress site at WP Engine and would
#   likely result in a broken production site if modified in production (in
#   fact, permissions would prevent modification for many of these files). It is
#   strongly recommended that you do not attempt to modify these files in
#   production.
